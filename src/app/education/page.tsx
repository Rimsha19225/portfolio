        <p className="font-semibold text-xl text-justify">I am currently in my final year of a BS Mathematics program, building on a strong foundation in Science and Pre-engineering from my earlier studies. My academic journey began with a focus on science at the secondary level, where I developed a keen interest in understanding complex concepts and logical problem-solving. Moving into Pre-engineering in higher secondary education, I was able to deepen my analytical thinking, particularly in mathematics and physics, which laid the groundwork for my current studies.</p>
        <p className="font-semibold text-xl text-justify">In my undergraduate program, I have explored advanced topics in mathematics, including calculus, algebra, and differential equations. These subjects have not only enhanced my technical knowledge but also refined my critical thinking and analytical skills. Additionally, my coursework has involved practical applications of mathematical theories, which has allowed me to understand the importance of precision, attention to detail, and logical reasoning in solving real-world problems.</p>
        <p className="font-semibold text-xl text-justify">This academic experience has also enabled me to pursue interests beyond pure mathematics, including coding and project work in web development, where Iâ€™ve applied mathematical concepts to programming. I am eager to integrate my educational background into a professional role, where I can leverage these skills and continue to learn and grow.</p>
